# supervised-models
Most major supervised models trained on kaggle datasets, evaluated and then compared
Also a thorough data analysis and visualization.
The list of models trained are
1) Regression tree
2) Classification tree
3) linear regression
4) polynomial regression
5) ridge regression
6) lasso regression
7) elastic net regression
8) knn
9) svm
10) naive bayes
11) logistic regression
12) random forest\
Various tuning methds were used such as bagging, gradient boosting, gridsearchcv and randomsearchcv
